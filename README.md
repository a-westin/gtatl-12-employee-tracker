  ### Usage
  
  After sucessful installation, open the folder with a code editor (Visual Studio Code is recommended) and in the terminal, run 'node app.js' to begin the application.
  
  The user will need to run through a series of prompts in the command line. They will have the option to:
  
  * View all employees, sorted by department or by manager, if desired
  * View all departments
  * View all roles
  * Add, remove, or edit an employee
  * Add, remove, or edit a department
  * Add, remove, or edit a role
  * Quit (ends the application)
  
  When making changes to an employee, department, or role, the user will first need to verify that they have intended to make that particular selection.
